and This Reverses a string in JAVA
<h1> WHY JAVA?</h1>
Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other programming languages.
One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily from one computer system to another. The ability to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web software, and Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels.

<h1>Reverse a String </h1>
What does it mean to reverse a string?
We want the string reversed, which means that we end up with all our letters positioned backwards. If you need a quick review of string s, check out our lesson on arrays and strings. We know that string s can be thought of as character arrays-- that is, each element in the array is a single character.
